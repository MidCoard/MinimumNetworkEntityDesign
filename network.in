# we decide to use entities from 1

# there are 3 main types of entities: PC SWITCH ROUTER
# and if we want to connect it to Root entity, we should add 'D' to the end of the entity name
# such as PCD SWITCHD ROUTERD
# tips: we ignore the case of the entity name

# for PC
# you can specify the ip address and mac of the entity
# (make sure ip address belongs to its network segment and you should provide its gateway(or default by its router))
# and the socket ip of the physical layer
# i.e. PC ip(gateway) mac physical_layer_ip
PC 10.0.0.2(10.0.0.1)
PC 10.0.0.3(10.0.0.1)
PC 10.0.0.4
PC

# for ROUTER
# you can specify the network segment of the entity or it will be automatically generated by its subnet ip
# i.e. ROUTER network_segment subnet_mask
ROUTERD

# for SWITCH
# i.e. SWITCH mac
SWITCH
SWITCH
# you can determine the port of the entity or not
# use port 1 of entity 6
1 (6,1)
# not specified, use next port of the entity 6
2 6
# use port 2 of entity 6
3 (6,2)

# if we want to ignore some arguments, we can use '-'
# i.e. SWITCH 23:00:00:00:00:00
