# we decide to use entities from 1 because there is a ISP entity in 0

# there are 3 main types of entities: PC SWITCH ROUTER
# and if we want to connect it to ISP entity, we should add 'I' to the end of the entity name
# such as PCI SWITCHI ROUTERI
# tips: we ignore the case of the entity name

# for PC, in our design, it only has one port
# you can specify the static ip address, mac and physical_layer_ip of the entity
# (make sure ip address belongs to its network segment and you should provide its gateway and subnet mask)
# you cannot only specify the ip address, the mask or the gateway, you should specify all of them
# i.e. PC ip subnet_mask*ip gateway*ip mac physical_layer_ip
PC 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1
PC 10.0.0.3 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1

# for ROUTER, in our design, it only has one WAN port and multiple LAN ports
# WAN port is always 0, and LAN ports are from 1 to n
# first you should specify the size of the LAN ports
# also you can ignore it(or enter 0), and all configuration will be done automatically(it will detect its subnet automatically)
# you can specify the network segment, subnet_mask, gateway of the router for the multiple LAN ports
# we will consider the gateway as its LAN port ip address
# and it will apply for its address from its top level entity(such as ISP, Router)  (will failed if the ISP has no address or cannot assign one)
# if it has no top level entity, you can use the network without any limitation
# you can specify the mac and physical_layer_ip of the port
# you can also set the whole router's LAN ports are in a private network with flag in the WAN port setting
# i.e. ROUTER 2
# ip0 mac0 physical_layer_ip0 flag(if true, the above LAN port setting is not allowed) network_segment subnet_mask gateway(the segment,mask and gateway settings are all for private network) (for WAN port)
# network_segment1 subnet_mask1 gateway1 mac1 physical_layer_ip1 (for LAN port)
# network_segment2 subnet_mask2 gateway2 mac2 physical_layer_ip2 (for LAN port)

# for SWITCH, in our design, it can have multiple ports for exchanging packets
# first you should specify the size of the ports
# also you can ignore it(or enter 0), and all configuration will be done automatically(it will detect its connected PCs automatically)
# you can specify the mac and physical_layer_ip of the port

# you can determine the port of the entity or not
# you mush specify the port 0 of router(if the router does not connect to ISP)
# use port 1 of entity 6
1 (6,1)
# not specified, use next port of the entity 6
2 6
# use port 2 of entity 6

# note:
# if you want to ignore some arguments, you can use '-'
# if you want to ignore one line, you can use '-'
# if some arguments are a must, we will assign it with '*'
# if some arguments are a must because of the previous arguments, we will assign it with '+$previous_arguments'
# physical_layer_ip is the ip with port(such as 127.0.0.1:12345)
# i.e. PC ip subnet_mask*ip gateway*ip mac physical_layer_ip
